In a data-driven replenishment strategy, data analysis plays a crucial role. It involves the following components:

**1. Data Analysis:** This involves analyzing data on sales, inventory levels, lead times, and customer demand to inform replenishment decisions.

**2. Demand Forecasting:** Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for determining when to reorder products and how much to order. This can help avoid stockouts and overstocks.

**3. Inventory Management:** Effective inventory management can ensure that you have the right amount of stock on hand to meet customer demand, without tying up too much capital in unsold goods.

**4. Supplier Management:** Data on supplier performance can help you choose reliable suppliers and manage relationships effectively.
