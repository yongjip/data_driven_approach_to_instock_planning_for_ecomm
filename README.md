# Definition of Ecommerce

Ecommerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods or services using the internet, and the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions. It is also known as internet commerce or online commerce.

Ecommerce can take on a variety of forms involving different transactional relationships between businesses and consumers, as well as different objects being exchanged as part of these transactions. Here are the main types:

* **B2C (Business-to-Consumer):** This is the most common form of ecommerce. This model represents a transaction between a business and a consumer. For example, when you buy a pair of shoes from an online retailer, it's a business-to-consumer transaction.
* **B2B (Business-to-Business):** In a B2B model, a business sells its products or services to another business. Sometimes the buyer is the end user, but often the buyer resells to the consumer.
* **C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer):** In a C2C model, consumers sell directly to other consumers. Platforms such as eBay, Olx, and Amazon, have popularized online marketplaces where consumers can sell goods to other consumers.
* **C2B (Consumer-to-Business):** In a C2B model, consumers sell their products or services to a business or group. This is common for freelancing websites, where a professional offers their services to various businesses.

Ecommerce transactions can also take place on various platforms, such as:

* **Online Stores:** The most common type of ecommerce, online stores typically operate via a website or mobile app. They can sell physical goods, digital goods, or services.
* **Marketplaces:** These platforms host products from multiple sellers. Examples include Amazon, Coupang, eBay, and Etsy.
* **Social Media:** Many social media platforms now support ecommerce transactions. For example, Facebook has a Marketplace where users can buy and sell items.
* **Email & Mobile:** Businesses can also sell products and services via email or mobile apps
