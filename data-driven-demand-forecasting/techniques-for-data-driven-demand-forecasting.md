# Techniques for Data-Driven Demand Forecasting

There are several techniques that businesses can use to perform data-driven demand forecasting. The choice of technique depends on factors like the nature of the business, the amount and quality of data available, and the specific forecasting needs. Here are some commonly used techniques:

**1. Time Series Analysis:** This technique involves analyzing historical data to identify patterns or trends over time. These patterns can then be extrapolated to predict future demand. Common methods of time series analysis include moving averages and exponential smoothing.

**2. Causal Models:** These models assume that demand is influenced by certain external factors or variables. They use statistical techniques, such as regression analysis, to quantify the relationship between these variables and demand.

**3. Machine Learning Models:** These models use algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. They can handle large amounts of data and complex relationships, making them suitable for businesses with diverse product ranges or complex supply chains. Examples include decision trees, neural networks, and deep learning models.

**4. Multivariate Analysis:** This technique involves analyzing multiple variables at once to predict demand. It can be useful for businesses that have multiple influencing factors, such as price, marketing activities, and seasonal trends.

**5. Simulation Models:** These models simulate different scenarios to predict their impact on demand. They can be useful for testing the potential effects of different business strategies or external events.

**6. Hybrid Models:** These models combine two or more forecasting techniques to improve accuracy. For example, a business might use a time series model to predict baseline demand and a causal model to account for the impact of promotional activities.
